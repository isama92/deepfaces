# DeepFaces package requirements

The package DeepFaces offers a web layer to load and/or show a list of faces pictures generated by a Deep Learning Model.
These pictures are provided by the website [https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), 
which, at every access, generates a brand new random, non-repeatable face.

The service must (should) provide the following:

1. An `/deepfaces` _endpoint_ showing a _basic html page_ with a list of face images. The endpoint could be called with an optional parameter specifying the number of faces to load.   
2. A _service_ allowing to fetch face images for other uses.
3. A _Facade_ for accessing the fetching service with a static interface.
4. The _number of faces to fetch_ for each call can be parameterized with:
   
   - a _default_, _configurable value_
   - a _specific value_ for each call
5. The images should be resized to a given size, which can be specified in the configuration file.
6. Both the _view_ and _config_ files can be _edited_ in the host application.
